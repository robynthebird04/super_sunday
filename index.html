<h2> My Super Bowl Sunday<h2/>

<p>My Super Bowl Sunday's normally aren't eventful and I'm normally watching the Super Bowl Performance because that's
more entertaining to me. However for the 2025 Super Bowl, me and some of my friends are going to this gay club to watch 
it there instead. I'm honestly excited to see the 2025 Super Bowl Performance because I'm a huge fan of the artists, Kendrick
Lamar and SZA.</p>

<p>I'm a big fan of their work seperately but when Sza and Kendrick collaborate together it's pretty fun. Years ago when 
the SZA's album called CTRL came out called Doves in the Wind. Would reccomend anyone that track especially the CTRL album as a whole</p>
